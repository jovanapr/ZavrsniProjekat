        <h1 class="text-light pt-4">GIVE WITH MEANING</h1>
        <p class="text-light pt-2 px-5 mainparagraf">For over 110 years, as the floral-gifting experts, we’ve been
            helping you give with more care, with greater ease, and with more meaning.<br>

            Established in 1910 as a collective of 10 florists, Florists’ Transworld Delivery (FTD) used the telegraph
            to transform the age-old practice of flower-giving. We understood then the unique power of flowers to
            express a sentiment and helped people across the world “Say it with flowers.” Today, we have grown into an
            extensive network made up of thousands of local florists — each one an artisan who is handcrafting and
            hand-delivering fine bouquets all across the country.
            <br>
            When you’re giving with FTD you’re giving the gift of joy, strength, and love and you're giving it with
            meaning.
